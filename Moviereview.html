        <h2>plot summary</h2>
        <p>Sandeep Reddy Vanga - Desi Tarantino! Like a Tarantino film, Sandeep Reddy Vanga's Animal (2023) is <u>unconventional and non-conforming</u>. An intense family saga full of emotions, drama, romance, vengeance & loads of blood, gore and graphic violence. A Tarantino film is deviant art.</p><br>

<h3>Moral of the movie</h3>
<p> intense familial loyalty, toxic masculinity, and the destructive consequences of unchecked obsession</p>
